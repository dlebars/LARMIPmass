# KPZ

In this repository, we can share code on the EC-EARTH project

Organization of the repo:

data: All input data that we need. For now we have the LRF from Levermann et al. 2020 and the total mass LARMIP2 model data (Larmip4ECEarth).

outputs: The results that we generate ourselves. For now we have the total LRF (RFunctions_total).
